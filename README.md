# DojoCourse

Applying for a job, the potential employer mentioned DotNest in the conversation. I never heard of it, so back home I decided to Google for DotNest. It appeared to be a SaaS provider for hosted Orchard Core web applications. And that is where it became interesting; Orchard Core is an open source, modular, multi-tenant application framework and CMS which can be built upon ASP.NET Core. So a complete and already-built CMS for ASP.NET! So NO need to reinvent the wheel.
Definitly worthwhile investigating I would say! This repository contains files and code created when following the full Orchard Core Dojo Course 3 CMS tutorial.
